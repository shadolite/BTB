## Bruhman Translator's Bible (BTB)

A Bible compiled in Markdown for the [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) platform. This Bible provides English-speaking users access to study the scriptures in their original Greek and Hebrew.
### Overview

Every verse is broken down by the Greek or Hebrew in an interlinear format. Every word links to its comprehensive lexical entry to help you study, analyze, and understand the meaning of each original language word.  Use this Bible to develop your own translations of the original scripture by tapping into Obsidian's note-taking interface to note, track, and manage your studies.

This Bible can be studied individually or in a group setting.

This work builds on the efforts of many scholars, theologians, and scribes whose painstaking digitization, analysis, and correction of ancient publications began years before modern tools made such tasks easier. The groups and individuals listed in the [Acknowledgments](#acknowledgments) section below generously made their work freely available and provided the foundation for this project.

**Important:** Initial setup requires patience. After cloning the repository or downloading the archive of almost 150,000 individual "notes", it takes Obsidian up to an hour to build a database and index all the connections. Once complete, navigation is quick.  In spite of the wait, it's still faster than same-day Prime, and it's free.

## Features

- **Chapter View**: Full chapters from the majority text with Jesus' words in red letters, pericope headings with cross-references, and over 500,000 footnotes
- **Section Headings**: link to their pericope (sounds like calliope, not like periscope), Greek for "a cutting out", which is a page for every section where you develop your own translations and keep notes.
- **Multiple Translations**: Individual verses include a traditional translation from the majority text, a modern translation from the critical text, and a literal word-for-word translation from the original Greek, Hebrew, or Aramaic
- **Septuagint Integration**: Interlinear NT Greek and OT Hebrew verses, plus all OT Greek verses from the Septuagint with word-for-word translations. The Septuagint (LXX) was the Bible known to the NT author's and so represents the scripture often quoted or referenced in the NT.  This edition of the LXX is derived from the [Apostolic Bible Polyglot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apostolic_Bible_Polyglot) and cross-referenced with the Masoretic text
- **Lexicon Links**: Each word links to its BTB lexicon entry, compiled from multiple sources and disambiguated (e.g., clicking "Mary" shows the entry for that specific person, not just the general name)
- **Scripture Cross-References**: Embedded references show where verses quote, reference, or allude to other passages—helpful when studying New Testament citations of the Septuagint
- **Translator's Notes**: Notes from the Translator's Amalgamated Hebrew Old Testament and Greek New Testament explain word order differences, variant spellings and definitions, and textual variations across sources
- **Nave's Topical Concordance**: Press the hotkey to search the concordance of more than 20,000 topics and sub-stopics with links to over 100,000 passages

## Installation

1. Download or clone this repository
2. Open the folder as a vault in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)
3. **Be patient during initial indexing** - Obsidian will need approximately one hour to index all files
4. Enable CSS snippets and select the `btb.css` snippet file (located in the `.obsidian` folder and the repository root)
5. Set reading view as the default when opening notes (in Obsidian settings)
6. (Optional) For map features, obtain a [Google Maps API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript), then use VS Code to find and replace `[GoogleAPIKey]` with your key throughout the project

_Note: No Obsidian plugins are required, though [there are many](https://obsidian.md/plugins) that might further enhance usability._
